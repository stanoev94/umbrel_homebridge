# Homebridge Docker Image

This Ubuntu Linux based Docker image allows you to run [Nfarina's](https://github.com/nfarina) [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) on your home network which emulates the iOS HomeKit API.

This is a multi-arch image and will run on x86_64, Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 4, Zero 2 W, or other Docker-enabled ARMv7/8 devices. Docker will automatically pull the correct image for your system.

## Step-By-Step Guides

- [Running Homebridge with Docker on Linux](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Install-Homebridge-on-Docker)
- [Running Homebridge on a Synology NAS](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki/Homebridge-on-Synology)
- [Running Homebridge on Unraid](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki/Homebridge-on-Unraid)

## Compatibility

Homebridge requires full access to your local network to function correctly which can be achieved using the ```--net=host``` flag.

**This image will not work when using [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) due to [this](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/68) and [this](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/543)**.


## Usage

Command Line:

```bash
docker run --net=host --name=homebridge -v $(pwd)/homebridge:/homebridge oznu/homebridge:latest
```

Using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (recommended):

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  homebridge:
    image: oznu/homebridge:latest
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./volumes/homebridge:/homebridge
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "10mb"
        max-file: "1"
```

## Parameters

The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side.

* `--net=host` - Shares host networking with container, **required**
* `-v /homebridge` - The Homebridge config and plugin location, **required**

##### *Optional Settings:*

* `-e TZ` - for [timezone information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) e.g. `-e TZ=Australia/Canberra`
* `-e ENABLE_AVAHI` - default is `1`; set to `0` to prevent the Avahi mDNS service running in the container

## Homebridge UI

This image comes with the [Homebridge UI](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) pre-installed and is the easiest way to manage all aspects of Homebridge.

To manage Homebridge go to `http://<ip of server>:8581` in your browser. For example, `http://192.168.1.20:8581`. From here you can install, remove and update plugins, modify the Homebridge config.json and restart Homebridge.

## Automated Updates

Automated updates of the Homebridge Docker Image using tools such as Watchtower or similar are strongly discouraged and are done so at your own risk. You can update Homebridge, the Homebridge UI and the Node.js runtime from inside the container.

## Troubleshooting

#### 1. Need ffmpeg?

ffmpeg, with `libfdk-aac` audio support is included in this image.

#### 2. Container will not start on older versions of Raspbian

If you're seeing errors like the following, your host operating system needs to be updated.

See [#434](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/issues/434) and [#441](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/issues/441) for potential solutions.

```
Node.js[445]: ../src/util.cc:188:double node::GetCurrentTimeInMicroseconds(): Assertion `(0) == (uv_gettimeofday(&tv))' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

```

```

```
